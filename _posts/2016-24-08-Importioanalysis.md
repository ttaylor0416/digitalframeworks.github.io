## Analyzing The Ringer with Import.io 
Bill Simmons’ website The Ringer made for an interesting study. I wanted to find out which topics the site covers most frequently, but unfortunately, Import.io could only provide information for every article on The Ringer’s homepage. Import.io couldn’t match the subcategories on the homepage to the topics within those subcategories. As a result, I couldn’t figure out, for instance, how many articles the website has posted about the NFL. I could only see an article about the NFL if it appeared on the homepage. 

Import.io did manage to extract the first 12 articles, which appeared on the homepage. The topics of those articles ranged from several about the NFL to one titled Disneyland, bowling and anglerfish. My guess from this tiny amount of data, and from what I know about the site, is that if Import.io had worked the way I wanted it to, there would have been many articles about the NFL and other sports, and then numerous one-off articles, such as the one about Disneyland.
