# Regression data for Wheat Production

I looked at world wheat use vs. world wheat production. Unsurprisingly, the use and production fit the upward linear line pretty closely, with an R value of 0.861. That means the supply of wheat is doing a relatively good job of matching demand worldwide. Unlike in a typical linear line, there won’t come a tipping point for one of the scatter plots. It seems consistent enough to match up – sometimes production is less than consumption, but it evens out in the following year. There won’t come a point when production will be less than demand. 

The Y intercept for the chart is at negative 90. I’m not sure what this means, to be honest. The forecast predicts that if worldwide wheat production ever reached 768.65 tons, it would exceed demand. But based on the rest of the chart, it doesn’t look like that will happen.
